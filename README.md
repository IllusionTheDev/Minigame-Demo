# Minigame-Demo
Hey there, lately I've been writing a lot of minigames and overall minigame code, so I'd like to give some insights into my journey and overall writing scalable minigame code.

My major source of inspiration and the reason why I even decided to dabble in this topic was Minikloon's guide on minigame code and finite-state machines (https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/organizing-your-minigame-code-using-fsmgasm.235786/), so I'd suggest reading that first.

The entire guide has been moved to the wiki.

I will be updating this guide with more information as I see fit. A lot of my current minigame code is still being polished, but expect updates on team handling, scoreboards, maps and a full demo game!
